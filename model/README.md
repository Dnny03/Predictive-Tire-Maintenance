# Predictive-Tire-Maintenance
This project uses mahcine learning to predict tire failure based on tread depth, mileage, pressure, and temperature

# Folder Structure'
- data - contains tire data (Tire_Data_1000.csv)
- model - containsthe python scrpt to train the model (train_model.py)

# How to Run
1. make sure you have Python installed
2. Install dependencies 
     bash
     pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. run the model script
   cd model
